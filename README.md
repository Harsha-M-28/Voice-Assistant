V🔊 Voice Assistant Coding – Overview for Beginners

A voice assistant is a software program that can understand voice commands and respond with actions or speech. Examples include Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. You can create a simple voice assistant using programming languages like Python.

✅ Key Components in Voice Assistant Coding

1. Speech Recognition
Converts spoken language into text.

📦 Python Library: speech_recognition



2. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Converts text into spoken audio.

📦 Python Library: pyttsx3



3. Natural Language Processing (Optional)
Understands and interprets user commands.

📦 Tools: nltk, transformers (advanced)



4. Task Execution
Based on the command, the assistant performs actions like:

Telling time/date

Opening websites

Playing music

Searching the web

🧠 How It Works – Basic Flow

[User Voice] → Speech Recognition → Text Command → Process Logic → Text-to-Speech → [Voice Response]

🐍 Example in Python

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import datetime
import webbrowser

# Initialize the text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

def listen():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = r.listen(source)
    try:
        command = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"You said: {command}")
        return command.lower()
    except:
        speak("Sorry, I didn't get that.")
        return ""

def run_voice_assistant():
    speak("Hello! How can I help you?")
    command = listen()
    
    if "time" in command:
        time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M %p')
        speak(f"The current time is {time}")
    elif "open google" in command:
        webbrowser.open("https://www.google.com")
        speak("Opening Google.")
    else:
        speak("Sorry, I can't do that yet.")
